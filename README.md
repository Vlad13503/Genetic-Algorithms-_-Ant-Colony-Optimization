# Genetic-Algorithms-_-Ant-Colony-Optimization

This is a continuation of the previous project with the Artificial Neural Network. The challenge is to enable a robot to navigate in the supermarket and find multiple products. The supermarket will be modeled as a labyrinth (“maze”).
We use a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in order to determine the fastest route between a set of locations to visit.  
Before we can determine the fastest way to visit all locations, we should have an idea of what the distance is between these locations. To achieve this, we implemented a swarm intelligence approach. Specifically, path finding based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).
